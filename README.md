Algorithm Visualizer (C)

Description:
The Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive, terminal-based program written in C that demonstrates fundamental sorting and searching algorithms in a step-by-step, visual format. The project is designed to help learners understand how algorithms manipulate data, while also showcasing core programming skills such as pointers, arrays, and file handling.

Key Features:
Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort
Searching Algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search
Interactive Menu: Choose an algorithm, input array size or random data
Step-by-Step Visualization: Displays array changes after each operation using ASCII graphics
Optional File Handling: Save and load arrays to practice file I/O
Skills Demonstrated:
C programming (pointers, arrays, structs, loops)
Algorithm implementation and visualization
Interactive CLI design
File operations (optional)
Logical thinking and problem-solving


Usage:
Clone the repository
Compile using gcc main.c algorithms.c -o visualizer
Run with ./visualizer and follow the on-screen menu
